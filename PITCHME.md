# How To Money

---

## Disclaimer

- I am not a qualified financial advisor |
- None of this is financial advice |
- I'm just a guy that read some stuff on the internet |
- You probably shouldn't listen to me |

---

## What I _won't_ talk about

- How you should spend your money |
- How much you should save |
- What you should invest in |

---

## What I _will_ talk about

- Benefits and downsides to different kinds of saving |
- Options: stocks, mutual funds, index trackers |
- Aligning how you use your money with your priorities |

---

## Who this is for

Note:
- We're all pretty lucky in that we've got relatively well paying jobs
- and probably not crippling mountains of (non-student debt)
- Paying down credit card debt is out of scope

---

## Why care about money?

- Get where you want to go faster |

Note:
- You can probably go on with your life not worrying too much about how much money you have and being reasonably conservative with your spending
- That's fine - but if you have goals like most people (travel, buying a house, weddings) more control can help you achieve your goals faster
---

## Investing

- Your cash is burning |
- To stop it burning, you need to grow it |
- Unfortunately, there's no really safe way to grow it |

---
## Cash accounts
- Cash ISAs probably aren't worth it |
- Check MoneySavingExpert for best current deals |
- In general (currently) will get lower return than inflation |

Note:
- Cash ISAs generally have a lower interest rate, and you no longer pay tax on first Â£1000 of interest earned
- This means at 2% interest rate, you'd need to have 50K cash in order to see benefit of ISA (and most ISAs have lower rates)
- Help To Buy ISA - if you think you'll ever buy a house, get one & max it out
- Sometimes you can get better rates in current accounts than savings accounts
Note:
- Help To Buy - you get the bonus as cash AFTER you buy your house, so it doesn't count towards your deposit
- Will hopefully mean you don't pay lawyers' fees
- If buying with another person, make sure you both get one (double bonus)
---
## Stocks and shares
- S&S ISA - super easy to set up through Hargreaves Lansdown |
- Potential for a much higher return, but also higher risk |
- Risk reduces long-term (5-10 years) |
- Shorter term, more of a gamble. |
---
## Options for investments
- Buying stocks directly |
- Industry specific funds - e.g. emerging markets, ethical, green |
- Mutual funds |
- Index trackers |
  - _Much_ lower fees, probably gives about the same return |
- Bonds (and bond trackers) |

Note:
- Only buy stocks if you _really_ know what you're doing 
- Warren Buffet bet - over 10 years, challenged someone to pick a set of mutual funds that would beat the S&P 500 (after accounting for fees) - won the bet
- Managed funds generally charge 2-3% (whether your money goes up or down), while index trackers will be around 0.5%
- When looking at historical returns, remember it *doesn't* account for fees

# Budgeting
---
## What does budgeting mean?
Note:
- The money you earn is somewhat like a reflection of your value
- The money you spend _should_ be the same - but often isn't
- Ideally, you want to spend more money on the things you value most, and less on what you don't
---
## The two types of budgeting mistake
1. Spending money which you shouldn't have |
2. Not spending money which you could have |
---
## Possible strategies
---
## The multiple accounts strategy
- Multiple bank accounts for multiple purposes - income, day-to-day spending, fun money, holiday |
- Benefit - more visibility and accountability |
- Downside - more hassle & admin |
---
## The 'let's just hope' strategy
- One bank account and working out in head |
- More likely to make budgeting mistakes |
---
## YNAB
- You Need A Budget
---
# The Four Rules
---
## 1. Give Evey Dollar A Job
Note:
- Assign priorities to your money *as it comes in*
- Means that when you later need to decide on spending, you can refer back to those priorities
---
## 2. Embrace your true expenses
Note:
- Take infrequent expenses and put money aside consistently - e.g. Christmas, insurance, car insurance
- No more lean months when your car breaks down - you've got money stashed away
- Essentially breaking everything into a monthly payment
---
## 3. Roll with the punches
Note:
- When you get an unexpected expense, move the money from another category
- Clear visibility of how you're chainging your priorities
--- 
## 4. Age your money
Note:
- Budget for next month's expenses with this month's money
- Get out of the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle - never end the month feeling broke/poor
---
## YNAB
- A method and a software package |
- Total view over what you can and can't spend |
- More time upfront & regular review, but gives you more confidence |
