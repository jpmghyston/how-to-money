# How To Money

---

## Disclaimer

- I am not a qualified financial advisor |
- I'm just a guy that read some stuff on the internet |
- You probably shouldn't listen to me |

---

## What I _won't_ talk about

- How you should spend your money
- How much you should save
- What you should invest in

---

## What I _will_ talk about

- Benefits and downsides to different kinds of saving
- Stocks, mutual funds, index trackers
- Aligning how you use your money with your priorities

---

## Who this is for

Notes:
- We're all pretty lucky in that we've got relatively well paying jobs
- and probably not crippling mountains of (non-student debt)
- Paying down credit card debt is out of scope

---

## Why care about money?

- Get where you want to go faster

Notes:
- You can probably go on with your life not worrying too much about how much money you have and being reasonably conservative with your spending
- That's fine - but if you have goals like most people (travel, buying a house, weddings) more control can help you achieve your goals faster

## Investing

- Your cash is burning
- To stop it burning, you need to grow it
- Unfortunately, there's no safe way to grow it

---
## Cash accounts
- Cash ISAs probably aren't worth it
- Check MoneySavingExpert for best current deals
- In general (currently) will get lower return than inflation
Notes:
- Cash ISAs generally have a lower interest rate, and you no longer pay tax on first Â£1000 of interest earned
- This means at 2% interest rate, you'd need to have 50K cash in order to see benefit of ISA (and most ISAs have lower rates)
- Help To Buy ISA - if you think you'll ever buy a house, get one & max it out
- Sometimes you can get better rates in current accounts than savings accounts
Notes:
- Help To Buy - you get the bonus as cash AFTER you buy your house, so it doesn't count towards your deposit
- Will hopefully mean you don't pay lawyers' fees
- If buying with another person, make sure you both get one (double bonus)
---
## Stocks and shares
- S&S ISA - super easy to set up through Hargreaves Lansdown
- Potential for a much higher return, but also higher risk
- Risk reduces long-term (5-10 years)
- Shorter term, more of a gamble.
---
## Options for investments
- Buying stocks directly
- Industry specific funds - e.g. emerging markets, ethical, green
- Mutual funds
- Index trackers
  - _Much_ lower fees, probably gives about the same return
- Bonds (and bond trackers)

Notes:
- Only buy stocks if you _really_ know what you're doing - 
- Warren Buffet bet - over 10 years, challenged someone to pick a set of mutual funds that would beat the S&P 500 (after accounting for fees) - won the bet
- Managed funds generally charge 2-3% (whether your money goes up or down), while index trackers will be around 0.5%
- When looking at historical returns, remember it *doesn't* account for fees
